# Required Feature 2: remote shells

This week you will use sockets develop the backdoor mechanism for our rootkit.

## Bind Shell vs Rev Shell



## Hint 

dup, execve

## Usage

To connect to the bind shell, you will need to use some sort of client to connect to the socket.

In this case we can use netcat, as simple program that allows 

`nc <target-ip> <port>`
